# Alcatraz_database

Application 
In the application you will first have to verify who you are and if you know the code once you are in the database you can see any information on a particular inmate you wish
name, age, charge, birthdate, homestate, and nickname will be given to you. 
for additional information you can hit xxx



Python
I decided to use Object Oriented Classes to create this program. I made two classes, prison and prisoner because of how much information was embedded in the code
Each individual prisoner had an ID number, I created a "find by id" function which would allow the user to access information 
After the basic data was pulled on a person you are given the choice to keep going and see other prisoners information because I created a while loop instead of the application just ending so quick
